This is an implemenation of the [Sierpinski Triangle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_triangle) using [PIXI.js](http://www.pixijs.com/).
I added some animations on top of it to demonstrate
the performance Pixi gives you out of the box.


<script data-slug-hash="Gflmy" data-user="jorin" data-height="400" data-default-tab="result" data-theme-id="8862" class='codepen' async src="//codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js" ></script>

If you want to create some fancy 3D graphic content on the web, give Pixi a try!

It's performance is pretty good and it supports rendering using WebGL or `<canvas>`.
